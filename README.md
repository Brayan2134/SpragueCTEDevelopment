<b>CTE</b> or Career Technical Education is a program offered in the Salem Keizer school district that allows a student (if granted via an application), to recieve on the hands training for various in-demand jobs, from construction to cosmetology. The program is only offered to Juniors & Seniors who have a high enough GPA and are motivated by these programs. Most students have jobs lined up out of high school. Because of this, students must give up 4 out of their 8 classes in order to recieve the training.
