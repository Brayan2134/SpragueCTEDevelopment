                        Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large." The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to market with goods for sale. From a sales process engineering perspective, marketing is "a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions" of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction.

                        The financial heart and soul of the 
                        business lies in the accountant. 
                        An accountant is a practitioner of accounting or accountancy, which is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about financial information that helps managers, investors, tax authorities and others make decisions about allocating resource(s).

                        Sprague's Accounting program is unlike no other. Accounting 1 introduces 
                        students into the fundamentals of the religious practice, that is, accounting.
                        Accounting 2 introduces students into the transaction, recording, and reporting pratices 
                        of an accountant. Accounting 3/4 ramps up the level by putting students into simulated, real-life 
                        accountant work. Students learn by doing, and at the end of the course, 
                        students should know every general aspect of an accountant.
