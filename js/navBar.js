 * Purpose:
 *          - This is the page where the navbar will be displayed on the page.
 *          - Place this at the top of the body of the html page.  
 *          - Code as normal Nav bar and make sure to add \ at the end of each line.    
 *          - Code will be pasted into the page.
 *      
 * General Notes:
 *          - Make sure to check the <base href="" /> and make sure that it goes to the 
 *            root dir, so it can work on any page.
 *          - If adding to nav later, pretend that your coding from the root folder.
