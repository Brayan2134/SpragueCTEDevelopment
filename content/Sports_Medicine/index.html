                    Have you ever been injured while playing a sport?
                    Been injured during any amount of physical activity and went to the doctor?
                    Chances are that if you have, they've advised you to seek a Sports Medicine Doctor.
                    Sports medicine doctors have special training
                    to restore function to injured patients so they can get moving again as soon as possible.
                    They are also knowledgeable about preventing illness and injury in active people.
                    Although sports medicine doctors do work with professional athletes,
                    they also treat children and teens involved in sports and adults who exercise for
                    personal fitness,
                    as well as people who have physically demanding jobs, like construction workers.
